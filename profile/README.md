# About the DiScho GitHub organization
This organization shares resources managed by [Digital Scholarship (DiScho) at Princeton University Library](https://library.princeton.edu/digital-scholarship/). Workshop curricula and quick guides created by our team and collaborators are openly available for access and reuse. Our goal is to facilitate the learning and use of digital tools and methods that promote digital scholarship. 

# How to use our repositories
The organization  currently contains the following repositories:
- *contribute*: Instructions for creating, adding, and updating DiScho curricula to github. In the future, this may also hold instructions for other ways to contribute to our repositories.
- *quick-guides*: This repository houses quick-start and short reference guides for digital tools and methods. To contribute to this repository, see the [quick-guide contribution instructions](https://github.com/PULdischo/quick-guides/blob/39581a81744404aac54fd264afb675eb5cb5d572/README.md).
- *curriculum*: Any workshop is considered curriculum and will have its own repository. For example, the DiScho “python-for-text” workshop series is a stand alone repository within our organization. To add a workshop repository, see our [curriculum contribution instructions](https://github.com/PULdischo/contribute/blob/82ca16aa3c8fda072fb1ab1df9e154909d2bc70f/contribute_workshop.md).
